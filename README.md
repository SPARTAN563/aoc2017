# AoC 2017 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SPARTAN563/aoc2017.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SPARTAN563/aoc2017)
**Advent Of Code 2017**

These are the pieces of code used to solve various puzzles as part of the AoC 2017 challenge.

All of the puzzles have their implementations unit tested using the `mocha` framework and `chai`,
with the puzzle examples codified into these tests. You will also find that there are a subset of
the tests which are solely responsible for calculating the results of the daily problems.

Results are printed to `stdout` and will be listed as part of the standard test output.

You can try the challenge yourself by visiting [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/)
and compete on my private leaderboard with the code `192559-638b1282`.
